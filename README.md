# Java Client-Server Communication

This repository contains two Java programs demonstrating basic client-server communication using sockets. One program acts as the server while the other acts as the client.

## Files

- `Client.java`: Java code for the client program.
- `Server.java`: Java code for the server program.

## Usage

1. **Compile the code**: Compile both `Client.java` and `Server.java` files using the Java compiler.

    ```bash
    javac Client.java
    javac Server.java
    ```

2. **Run the server**: Execute the server program first.

    ```bash
    java Server
    ```

3. **Run the client**: Then, run the client program in another terminal or command prompt.

    ```bash
    java Client
    ```

4. **Interact**: The client will send a message to the server, which will respond with a confirmation message.
